When knitting the .Rmd file, an .html file and an .md file were produced.

Now by default my pc has set the directory of the figures to be:
'RepData_PeerAssessment1/PA1_template_files/figures-html/*'

However the upload of the figures to the repo will be under:
'RepData_PeerAssessment1/figure/*'

This might affect the .md file such that it may not display the graphs on GitHub.
